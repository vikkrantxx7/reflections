When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If we want to access it from different device or if someone else is collaborating
    in the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    As this will give full control if we want to update the local repository or not.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork copies the repository in gihub account to another github account without the need
	to clone on local machine.
	Clone copies the repository in gihub account to local machine or from local machine to
	local machine.
	Branch creates a new branch which deviates from the main branch within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
